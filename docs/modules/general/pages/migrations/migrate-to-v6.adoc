= Migration to Generator v6

[WARNING]
====
BREAKING CHANGE: This is a major version update with breaking changes.
====

== Overview

Generator v6 introduces important breaking changes to align with modern API conventions and improve developer experience.

== Breaking Changes

=== API Folder Structure Change

[IMPORTANT]
====
*BREAKING CHANGE*: OpenAPI specification folder renamed from `swagger` to `api`
====

==== What Changed

The folder containing OpenAPI specifications has been renamed:

* **Before (v5)**: `src/assets/swagger/`
* **After (v6)**: `src/assets/api/`

==== Why This Change

This change aligns with modern API documentation conventions:

* The term "API" is more generic and widely understood
* "Swagger" is a specific toolset, while OpenAPI is the specification standard
* Improved consistency with industry practices
* Better clarity for new developers

==== Impact

This change affects:

* **Folder structure**: Generated projects will use `src/assets/api/` instead of `src/assets/swagger/`
* **Script commands**: The `apigen` script in `package.json` now references the new path
* **Generator steps**: All OpenAPI generation steps now use the new folder path

==== Migration Steps

If you have existing projects created with generator v5 or earlier:

1. **Rename the folder**:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd your-project
mv src/assets/swagger src/assets/api
----

2. **Update package.json script**:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "apigen": "openapi-generator-cli generate -i src/assets/api/your-project-bff.yaml -c apigen.yaml -o src/app/shared/generated -g typescript-angular --type-mappings AnyType=object"
  }
}
----

3. **Update any custom scripts or documentation** that references the old path

4. **Test the migration**:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run apigen
npm run build
npm run test
----

==== Automatic Migration

Currently, there is no automatic migration script. Manual migration is required for existing projects.

== Version Compatibility

* **Generator v6+**: Uses `src/assets/api/`
* **Generator v5 and earlier**: Uses `src/assets/swagger/`

== Support

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check that all file paths have been updated correctly
2. Verify that the `apigen` script uses the new path
3. Ensure your build and test processes work correctly
4. Consult the https://onecx.github.io/docs/[OneCX documentation] for additional guidance

== Changelog

=== v6.0.0

* **BREAKING**: Renamed API folder from `swagger` to `api`
* Updated all generator templates to use new folder structure
* Updated package.json scripts to reference new paths
