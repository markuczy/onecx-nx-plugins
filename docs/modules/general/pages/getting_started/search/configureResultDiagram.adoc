=== Configure the result diagram
By default, a diagram is created which counts the different values in a column and shows the results. To use this diagram, the column which should be displayed needs to be selected first. The member 'columnId' holds the column id of the column.

=== ACTION S9: Please select the column to be displayed
.Code snippet: <feature>-search.component.html
[example]
[subs=+macros]
----
    // ACTION: Please select the column to be displayed
    // columnId = 'id';
    // column = this.columns.find((e) => e.id === this.columnId);
        ....
----
Please comment in the two lines of code and specify the columnId which results should be displayed in the visual diagram component. The diagram component shows the distribution of data of the selected column.

[TIP] 
.Adjust the position of the result diagram
